        An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device
        used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to
        complex mathematics.
        <br />
        The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early
        1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s,
        especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was
        developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom. They
        later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and
        gas).
        <br />
        Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away
        credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in
        printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation
        of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of
        that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic
        calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.
        <br />
        Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included
        interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, and calculator
        functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant
        (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address
        book and dictionary devices.
        <br />
        In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed
        for specific markets. For example, there are scientific calculators
        which include trigonometric and statistical calculations. Some
        calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra. Graphing
        calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line,
        or higher-dimensional Euclidean space. As of 2016, basic calculators
        cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.
